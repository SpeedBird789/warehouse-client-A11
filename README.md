## About this project

In this project, I tried to make a Warehouse Management website. Due to time constraint, couldn't add a few more features and functionalities (due to exams arghhhh!!) which I hope will do once I sit with it again. To summarise:

* You can add inventories from the 'Add Items' section. To do so, you have to SignUp/Login first. Only the first 6 items are shown on the home page. Anything after that is shown in the 'Manage Items' section.
* In 'Manage Items', you can add or delete any items. Clicking on 'Add New Item' will navigate the user to the addinventory route where a new item can be added using a form.
* Hubs shows some of the international branches that the company operates from.
* About section is a short introduction of the company (it doesn't exist irl); nothing too serious here.
* Blogs section displays 3 web-dev related questions and their answers. This however is just for my practice and isn't necessarily related to this project.
